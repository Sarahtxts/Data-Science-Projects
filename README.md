## 📖 Overview

This project explores fundamental and advanced **data visualization techniques in Python**, focusing on practical, reproducible examples.  
The notebook demonstrates how to create a variety of plots for data analysis, including histograms, scatter plots, density plots, contour plots, annotated line plots, and interactive globe visualizations.  
Real-world scenarios, practical code comments, and best practices are emphasized throughout.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Present **core data visualization methods** for different data types and analysis goals.  
- Demonstrate usage of Python’s most popular visualization libraries.  
- Provide ready-to-modify code templates for common plots.  
- Enable students and data practitioners to quickly generate insights visually.

---

## 🧩 Key Features

- Comprehensive walkthrough of **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, and **Basemap**.  
- Step-by-step code examples for each visualization type.  
- Customizing color, style, labels, legends, and annotations.  
- Real dataset illustration and hands-on plotting.  
- Advanced visualization: annotated globe with Basemap.  
- Exam-ready explanations and clear code for each technique.

## 🛠️ Example Visualizations

- **Histograms:** Frequency distributions for exam scores  
- **Density/Kernel Plots:** Score distribution smoothness analysis  
- **Scatter Plots:** Relationships between Exam 1 and Exam 2 scores  
- **Contour Plots:** Sinusoidal function visualization with `contourf`  
- **Annotated Line Plots:** Savings over years with goal mark  
- **Globe Map:** Earth visualization & point annotation with Basemap

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone or Download** the repository/notebook.
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib seaborn basemap basemap-data-hires numpy
   ```
3. Open Data_Visualization_Techniques.ipynb in Jupyter or Google Colab.
4. Run all cells to view code, outputs, and modify examples for your own data.

# 📊 Data Visualization Techniques

## 📷 Sample Plots

- **Distribution histograms** and **density overlays** for exam scores.  
- **Scatter plot** comparing two sets of exam results.  
- **Contour-filled plot** of a 2D sine wave.  
- **Annotated line plot** showing savings over years.  
- **Interactive Earth globe** with a location marker (e.g., New York).

---

## 💡 Best Practices

- Use **annotations**, **gridlines**, and **legends** for better clarity.  
- Choose **plot types** that best represent the data insights sought.  
- Experiment with **color palettes** and **styling** for publication-ready visuals.
